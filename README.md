## Motivation 
In this era, there are usually too many things that can easily distracts us from things we are supposed to do, which has caused a great decrease in working efficiency. Conforming to this phenomenon, FocusPaw is born. 

We hope people can be attracted to focus actively by combining focus with cute dogs and cats which they might be interested in, especially for pet lovers. This is also a way to expand our target audience. 

Except for the idea to help people to focus, another important idea is to educate users about how to raise a real pet and understand that they shall be responsible for their decision to raise a pet. We hope exposing suffering of some pets can be a warning to educate people to treat their pets well. 

## Vision
FocusPaw is 

## Storyline
# Setting
The story starts from the Rest Centre!
This is a shop connected with Cat Star and Dog Star and you are a staff here. 
Your job is to heal your customer, the soul of dogs and cats. 

Every year, there are many cats and dogs going back to their respective star(die). Their soul will remember all the pain and sorrow they have experienced during their lifetime, which may cause a great burden on their soul. 
The greater the burden, the worse degeneration its soul will suffer. 

But an immature soul will not be able to reincarnate and go back to earth.  
Your job is to heal it and release its burden so that its soul can grow up until it is mature enough to reincarnate. 
Choose one puppy or kitten to start your work!

# Ending
After the user has successfully raised up the pet he or she choose, there is a choice to be made. 

“My soul seems to be mature enough to reincarnate. But I am still wondering whether I am able to find a good master. What if this time the life is still so painful and sorrowful?” The pet says.

Choice 1: Let it stay. 
Result: “I shall stay here for more time to be better prepared.”

Choice 2: Let it go.
Result: “Thank you for your care. I am ready to go back and find my new master! Good luck to me!”

## Features 
Features 1 (core): Time Tracker 
Users can create and name the schedules for tasks and then start timing.

Record distraction time when the app is in the backend. 

Feature 2 (core): Electronic Pet with Health and Growth Values
Users can only have 1 alive pet at a moment.
Users can choose between a dog and a cat as their virtual pet.   
Display a widget on the home screen showing the pet’s health value. 
Health value decreases by 1 health value per 2 hours, and increases by feeding (1 bone/ fish (reward) = 1 health value).
Health value’s upper limit is 100, below 40 triggers a weak notification to the user, and reaching 0 results in the pet’s death.
Maximum increase of health value is at most 30 per day.
Growth value has a default value of 0 and a maximum value of 60.
Growth value increases based on the pet’s health value: above 80 for 1 day adds 1 growth value (health value would be checked everyday at 00:00 am). 
Pet has default level of level 1, and it levels up at 30 and 60 growth points. (0 growth point = level 1; 30 growth value = level 2; 60 growth value = level 3) 
The pet’s outlook would be changed when it levels up.
Users have the ability to obtain a new pet after reaching level 3 and the current pet would be placed in the achievement book as a record.

Rewards type would be according to the pet the user is raising (cat -> fish, dog -> bone). 
Feeding the pet using bones/fishes increases its health value. 
Users would not lose their accumulated rewards when switching between cats and dogs as their new pet.
